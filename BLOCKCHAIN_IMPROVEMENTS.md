## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Monitoring Dashboards
The system now provides comprehensive monitoring through:

1. **Prometheus Metrics** (Port 9090)
   - Block metrics
   - Transaction metrics  
   - System resource metrics
   - Business metrics

2. **HTTP API** (Port 8080)
   - `/metrics` - Current performance metrics
   - `/health` - System health status
   - `/alerts` - Active performance alerts
   - `/recommendations` - Optimization recommendations
   - `/status` - Overall system status

3. **Performance Scores**
   - **Throughput Score**: Transaction processing efficiency
   - **Latency Score**: Block production speed
   - **Stability Score**: System resource health
   - **Overall Score**: Weighted performance indicator

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Transaction Throughput**: Target >100 TPS
- **Block Time**: Target <7 seconds
- **CPU Usage**: Keep <80%
- **Memory Usage**: Keep <85%
- **Overall Performance Score**: Maintain >70/100

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

The system includes default security rules:

1. **Velocity Monitoring**
   - Max transactions per hour: 100
   - Max amount per hour: 1,000,000 tokens
   - Action: Alert on violation

2. **Pattern Recognition**
