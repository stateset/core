# ssUSD Conservative Reserve Implementation

## Overview

The ssUSD stablecoin has been enhanced with a conservative reserve composition that ensures stability and liquidity through a diversified portfolio of low-risk, USD-denominated assets. This implementation provides 1:1 backing between ssUSD tokens and underlying reserves.

## Reserve Composition

Our conservative reserve structure ensures ssUSD stability and liquidity:

| **Treasury Bills** | 70% | U.S. T-Bills with ≤93 days maturity | ● Minimal |
| **Government MMFs** | 15% | Government-only money market funds | ● Minimal |
| **Overnight Repos** | 5% | Tri-party repo agreements | ● Low |

## 1:1 Backing Mechanism

### Issue (Mint) Process

When users want to issue new ssUSD tokens:

1. **Reserve Payment**: Users provide reserve assets matching the conservative composition
2. **Value Validation**: System calculates USD value of provided reserves
3. **1:1 Verification**: Reserve value must equal or exceed ssUSD amount requested
4. **Composition Check**: Payment must align with target allocations
5. **Token Issuance**: ssUSD tokens are minted and sent to user
6. **Reserve Update**: Reserve composition is updated with new assets

#### CLI Command Example:
```bash
# Issue 1000 ssUSD with conservative reserves
stateset tx stablecoins ssusd issue 1000000000 "100us_cash_token,700treasury_bill_token,150mmf_token,50repo_token" --from user
```

### Redeem (Burn) Process

When users want to redeem ssUSD tokens:

1. **Balance Verification**: User must have sufficient ssUSD balance
2. **Reserve Calculation**: System calculates equivalent reserve value (1:1)
3. **Asset Selection**: 
   - If preferred asset specified and available, prioritize it
   - Otherwise, redeem proportionally across all reserve types
4. **Token Burning**: ssUSD tokens are burned
5. **Reserve Transfer**: Equivalent reserve assets are sent to user
6. **Composition Update**: Reserve holdings are updated

#### CLI Command Examples:
```bash
# Redeem 500 ssUSD for proportional reserves
stateset tx stablecoins ssusd redeem 500000000 --from user

# Redeem 500 ssUSD preferring Treasury Bills
stateset tx stablecoins ssusd redeem 500000000 treasury_bill_token --from user
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Structures

```go
// Conservative reserve composition
type SSUSDConservativeReserve struct {
    CashReserves    SSUSDCashReserve    // 10%
    TreasuryBills   SSUSDTreasuryBills  // 70%
    GovernmentMMFs  SSUSDGovernmentMMFs // 15%
    OvernightRepos  SSUSDOvernightRepos // 5%
    TotalValue      sdk.Dec
    LastUpdate      time.Time
}
```

### Key Functions

1. **`IssueSSUSD(ctx, request)`**: Issues new ssUSD with reserve backing
2. **`RedeemSSUSD(ctx, request)`**: Redeems ssUSD for underlying reserves
3. **`validateReserveComposition(ctx, payment)`**: Ensures proper allocation
4. **`calculateReserveValue(ctx, reserves)`**: Calculates USD value of reserves
5. **`updateReserveComposition(ctx, assets, isAddition)`**: Updates reserve state

### Validation Rules

#### Issue Validation:
- Reserve payment must be valid coins
- Only approved asset types allowed
- Total reserve value ≥ ssUSD amount
- Payment must respect allocation guidelines

#### Redeem Validation:
- User must have sufficient ssUSD balance
- Preferred asset (if specified) must be valid
- Sufficient reserves must be available

## Price Integration

The system integrates with price oracles to ensure accurate valuation:

```go
func (engine *SSUSDStablecoinEngine) getAssetPrice(ctx sdk.Context, denom string) (sdk.Dec, error) {
    switch denom {
    case "us_cash_token", "treasury_bill_token", "mmf_token":
        return sdk.OneDec(), nil // $1.00 for USD-denominated assets
    case "repo_token":
        return sdk.OneDec(), nil // $1.00 for repo agreements
    default:
        // Query price oracle for other assets
        return sdk.OneDec(), nil
    }
}
```

## Security Features

### Risk Management
- **Diversification**: Multiple asset types reduce concentration risk
- **Maturity Limits**: Short-term assets ensure liquidity
- **Credit Quality**: Government-backed or FDIC-insured assets only
- **Regular Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of reserve composition

### Access Controls
- **Authorized Issuers**: Only whitelisted entities can issue large amounts
- **Emergency Pause**: Admin can pause issuance/redemption if needed
- **Audit Trail**: All transactions are logged with full transparency

### Operational Security
- **Multi-sig Requirements**: Large transactions require multiple signatures
- **Time Delays**: Large redemptions may have settlement delays
- **Reserve Monitoring**: Automated alerts for composition deviations

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Real-time Metrics
- Current reserve composition percentages
- Total reserve value vs. ssUSD supply
- Individual asset holdings and valuations
- Historical allocation trends

### Query Commands
```bash
# Get current reserve composition
stateset query stablecoins ssusd conservative-reserves

# Get ssUSD metrics
stateset query stablecoins ssusd metrics

# Get individual reserve asset details
stateset query stablecoins ssusd cash-reserves
stateset query stablecoins ssusd treasury-bills
stateset query stablecoins ssusd mmf-holdings
stateset query stablecoins ssusd repo-agreements
```

## Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

### Banking Regulations
- FDIC insurance coverage limits
- Bank selection criteria and monitoring
- Deposit diversification requirements

### Securities Regulations
- Money market fund regulations (Rule 2a-7)

3. **Asset Liquidation**: Convert less liquid assets as needed
4. **Communication**: Transparent updates to stakeholders

### Market Disruption
1. **Oracle Validation**: Verify price feed accuracy
2. **Trading Halt**: Temporary suspension if needed
3. **Manual Intervention**: Admin override for pricing
4. **Gradual Resume**: Phased restart of operations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
